# USV-Analysis-MStim-Preference-

USV_funcs contains helpful functions for categorizing and storing USV data for visualization. It is tailored to match the MStim Preference experiments which began 11/2019. Some of these functions may be useful for general USV analysis in the future. 

In the future I hope to include something that will cluster USV data, identifying functional groups.
